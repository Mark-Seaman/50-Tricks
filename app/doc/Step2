**Discussion**

This step demonstrates how to create a page that is styled by Twitter Bootstrap.  It also
loads Angular JS which allows front-end logic to be included in every web page.

A project specific stylesheet and JS library lets you style the application to suit your
needs.


**Improvements**

You may want to change the structure of your home page.  Edit project/templates/home.html
file to do that.

Edit project/app/urls.py file to add more pages to your site.

To change the appearance of your site edit project/static/thumper.css.
