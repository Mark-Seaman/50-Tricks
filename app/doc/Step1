* Step 1 - App Startup *                           -*-muse-*-


**Steps**

Make the top directory for your application.

   cd myAppName


Create the application framework using the following shell command.

   ./create myAppName


Modify urls.py

[[PRE
    from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    
    def hello(request):
        return HttpResponse('<h1>Hello There</h1><a href="/">About</a>')
    
    urlpatterns = patterns('',  
        url(r'^$', hello),
    )
]]

Run the production server to verify the setup.

    ./run


**Discussion**

Django provides two scripts that make it easy to get started on a new project.  To start a
new project structure do:

    django-admin.py startproject project

Now define an app (containing related Django models).  To build a new app within the project:

    python manage.py startapp app


**Improvements**

You might want to select the name of the project and app to create.  The create script is
hard-coded to 'project' and 'app'.


**To Do**

 * Build args into create and run.
